Simulation of cricket match

A TypeScript application to simulate the last 4 overs of the match, ball by ball.  

Steps to run the TypeScript application,

1. Start by downloading a code editor to write the code in. I used VSCode for this application. You can download whatever editor you like.

2. TSC is a command-line application written in TypeScript, which requires NodeJS to run it. Install the NodeJS on your machine. You can find the instructions to set NodeJS up from their official website.

3. Now we'll start installing TSC and TSLint using NPM (a package manager that comes from NodeJS). Start by typing the following command in your terminal:

# Initialize a new NPM project (follow the prompts)
npm init

# Install TSC, TSLint, and type declarations for NodeJS
npm install --save-dev typescript tslint @types/node
